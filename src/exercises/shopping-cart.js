/*
* Shopping Cart Requirements:
* - Before you start, please run `npm run start:api` to start mock API server
* - data for mock APIs come from ./db/db.json
* - There are 2 APIs you need to call:
*     - http://localhost:4002/cart : this will provide a list of product-ids for current shopping cart
*     - http://localhost:4002/products : this will provide a list of products with full details
*
* We want to display detail of items in shopping carts. i.e: user has added product 1001 and 1004 to the cart.
* product 1001 is TV and product 1002 is iPad. Thus, we would like to display them in tabular format
* inside table#shopping-cart-tbl as below:
* ID     Item
* 1001   TV
* 1002   iPad
*
* */
const View = {

    console.log('TODO: Please see the above requirement');
